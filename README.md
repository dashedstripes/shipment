# tinyshipnet

a minimalist neural network framework, built from scratch with no external dependencies.

this is a learning project, not for production use.

## goals

- build the foundations of a feed forward neural network
- implement an RGB classifier
- simplicity over performance
- be verbose

## todo

- implement matrix operations (~multiplication~, addition, subtraction, transposition)
- implement linear layer
